Q: If the customer has more than 1 ball, how would you reflect it in the database?

A: Because there are many different products and this value changes constantly you would most 
likly not want to store the value in the database but rather just make this a function we can run
each time we load the customers profile
'''

# Returns the total count for number of time a "Ball" was ordered by the first customer
ballOrders = firstCustomer.Booking_set.filter(service__name="Hair Cut").count()

# Returns total count for each product orderd
allOrders = {}

for order in firstCustomer.order_set.all():
    if order.product.name in allOrders:
        allOrders[order.product.name] += 1
    else:
        allOrders[order.product.name] = 1


# Returns: allOrders: {'Ball': 2, 'BBQ Grill': 1}
